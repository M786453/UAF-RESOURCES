* MATLAB is an abbreviation for "matrix laboratory."
* MATLABÂ® is designed to operate primarily on whole matrices and arrays.
* All MATLAB variables are multidimensional arrays
* A matrix is a two-dimensional array often used for linear algebra.
* To create an array with four elements in a single row, separate the elements with either a comma (,) or a space.
* An array which contains only one row is a row vector.
* To create a matrix that has multiple rows, separate the rows with semicolons.
* Another way to create a matrix is to use a function, such as ones, zeros, or rand.
* MATLAB allows you to process all of the values in a matrix using a single arithmetic operator or function.
* To transpose a matrix, use a single quote ('): a'
* MATLAB stores numbers as floating-point values, and arithmetic operations are sensitive to small differences between the actual value and its floating-point representation. You can display more decimal digits using the format command:
format long
p = a*inv(a)

* Reset the display to the shorter format using

format short

* To perform element-wise multiplication rather than matrix multiplication, use the .* operator:

p = a.*a

* raise each element of a to the third power:

a.^3

* Concatenation is the process of joining arrays to make larger ones.

*  In fact, you made your first array by concatenating its individual elements

*  The pair of square brackets [] is the concatenation operator.

* Concatenating arrays next to one another using commas is called horizontal concatenation
 Each array must have the same number of rows

*  when the arrays have the same number of columns, you can concatenate vertically using semicolons.

A = [a; a]


* Complex numbers have both real and imaginary parts, where the imaginary unit is the square root of -1.
sqrt(-1)
ans = 0.0000 + 1.0000i

* To represent the imaginary part of complex numbers, use either i or j.
