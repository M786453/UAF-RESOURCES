The desktop includes these panels:

* Current Folder — Access your files.

* Command Window — Enter commands at the command line, indicated by the prompt (>>).

* Workspace — Explore data that you create or import from files.

* When you do not specify an output variable, MATLAB uses the variable ans, short for answer, to store the results of your calculation.

* If you end a statement with a semicolon, MATLAB performs the computation, but suppresses the display of output in the Command Window.

* You can recall previous commands by pressing the up- and down-arrow keys, ↑ and ↓.
