WHAT IS HEURISTIC IN AI 
(Rule of thumb)?
Heuristic -> Guess

* It is a technique designed 
to solve a problem quickly

* non-ponimial problem mn time
complexity exponential ha

* follow greedy technique

* always provide good solution
but may or may not provide optimal
solution

* when we want to solve a non-
ponimal problem in polynomial time
then we use Heuristic search.

* we use heuristic technique when
we want the solution quickly

* quick solution

* eucledian distance -> straight 
line distance

* reduce time complexity

* Manhatten distance -> when we
want to find vertical and horizontal
distance

* in 8-puzzle problem,if you do
blind search then 3 ki power 20 
searches possible hn
