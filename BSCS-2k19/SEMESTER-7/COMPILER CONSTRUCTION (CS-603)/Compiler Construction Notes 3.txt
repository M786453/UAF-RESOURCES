ATTRIBUTE:
An attribute represent any uaxlity e.g, A string, type or memory location.

SYNTAX DIRECTED TRANSLATION:

A syntax directed definition specified the transalation of a construct in terms of attributes associated with its syntatic components.

POSTFIX NOTATION:

The postfix notation of an expression E can be defined as follows:

1. If E is a variable or constant, then postfix notaiton for E is E itself.
2. If E is an expression of the form E1 OP E2, where OP is any binary operation, then postfix notaton for E is E1E2OP, where E1 and E2 are the postfix notation of E1 and E2 respectively.
3. If E is an expression of the form (E1), then the postfix notation for E1 is also the postfix notation for E.

No parenthesis are needed in postfix notation because the position and arity (number of arguments) of the operators permits only one decoding of a postfix notation. 

SYNTAX DIRECTED DEFINITION:

SYNTAX DIRECTED DEFINITION = Grammar + Set of semantic Rules

1. It uses context-free grammar to to specify the syntatic structure of the input.
2. With each grammar symbol, it associates set of attributes.
3. With each production, it asociates set of semantic rules for computing the values of attributes associated with symbols appearing in that production.

A translation is an input-output mapping.

If x is a symbol at a node n in parse tree, then x.a will be the value attribute of symbol x. The value of x.a can be computed using the semantic rule for attribute a associated with production-x used at node n. 

ANNOTATED PARSE TREE:

A parse tree showing attribute values at each node is called ANNOTATED PARSE TREE.

SYNTHESIZED ATTRIBUTES:

An attribute is synthesized if it's value at a parse tree node is determined from attribute values at the children of the node.

They can be evaluated using a single bottom-up traversal.
